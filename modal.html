      <h2>Tips for using t.modal()</h2>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
        <li>You should only call t.modal() as a response to a user action, such as clicking a button.</li>
        <li>Try to use t.popup() when possible instead of t.modal() as it helps to better maintain context.</li>
        <li>Try to get your modal to load and render as quickly as possible.</li>
